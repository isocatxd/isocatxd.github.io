# isocat's Realm

Hello There!
I wouldn't usually expect people to browse this repository but I welcome you nonetheless!
Here you'll find the files used for my personal website, hosted over at [isocat.dev](https://isocat.dev)

As you can tell, there isn't much here at the moment.. but not to worry! Over time,
I'll be sure to add more content as my programming knowledge progresses. I plan on eventually
turning this into a portfolio of sorts, allowing me to showcase some of the projects I've worked on.
Alas, I have yet to really work on much yet. Well, stay tuned!
